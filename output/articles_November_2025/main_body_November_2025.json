  "executive_sum": "In today's rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, the notion of <strong>Bitcoin dominance</strong> is both a hotbed of debate and a reflection of market dynamics. While many assert that <strong>Bitcoin's</strong> prominence is steadfast, others argue that this perception may be misleading and potentially harmful to understanding the broader crypto market. As power shifts, does historic supremacy make way for emerging players?",
