  "content": "<p>The UK is poised to shape the future of stablecoin regulation with recent moves by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England. As of May 2025, the FCA released Consultation Paper 25/14, seeking public input on proposed regulatory frameworks that focus on both the issuance of stablecoins and custody of cryptoassets. This roadmap signifies an effort to ensure stability and competitiveness in the financial markets, aligning with evolving international standards.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, the UK's approach distinguishes between systemic stablecoins, regulated by the Bank of England, and non-systemic variants, managed under the FCA. The key proposals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishment of prudential requirements for stability.</li>\n<li>Consideration of user limits on stablecoin holdings.</li>\n<li>Alignment with global practices to foster adoption.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This consultation, culminating on February 10, 2026, marks a decisive moment for the UK's position in the evolving digital currency landscape.</p>"
