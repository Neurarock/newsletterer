  "content": "<p>The UK's Financial Services and Markets Bill, designed to introduce regulations for stablecoins, is facing criticism for its slow progress.

Key concerns surround the bill’s potential limitations on innovation and its capacity to establish the UK as a crypto-friendly economy. Industry leaders argue the current pace does not align with growing market demands and international competition, pushing for a faster and more comprehensive framework.</p>"
